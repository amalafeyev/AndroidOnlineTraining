        In a <b>real app</b> that accesses magazine or newspaper articles,
        \n\n
        the articles that appear would probably come from
        \n\n
        an online source through a content provider, or might be saved in advance in a database on the device.

For this practical, you will create the article as a single long string in the strings.xml resource.
        \n\n\n
In the app > res > values folder, open strings.xml.
        \n\n
Enter the values for the strings article_title and article_subtitle with a made-up title and a subtitle
        \n\n
        for the article you are adding. The string values for each should be single-line text without HTML
        \n tags or multiple lines.
Enter or copy and paste text for the article_text string.
Use the text provided for the article_text string in the strings.xml file of the finished ScrollingText app,
        \n or use your own generic text. You can copy and then paste the same sentence over and over, as long
        \n as the result is a long section of text that will not fit entirely on the screen. Keep in mind the
        \n following (refer to the figure below for an example):
As you enter or paste text in the strings.xml file, the text lines don't wrap around to the next line—they
        \n extend beyond the right margin. This is the correct behavior—each new line of text starting at the
        \n left margin represents an entire paragraph.
Enter \n to represent the end of a line, and another \n to represent a blank line.
Why? You need to add end-of-line characters to keep paragraphs from running into each other.
Tip: If you want to see the text wrapped in strings.xml, you can press Return to enter hard line endings, or
        \n format the text first in a text editor with hard line endings.
If you have an apostrophe (') in your text, you must escape it by preceding it with a backslash (\'). If you have
        \n a double-quote in your text, you must also escape it (\"). You must also escape any other non-ASCII
        \n characters.See the "Formatting and Styling" section of String Resources for more details.

    Enter the HTML and /i tags around words that should be in italics. Note, however, that if you use curled
        \n apostrophes within an italic phrase, you should replace them with straight apostrophes.
    You can combine bold and italics by combining the tags, as in ... words.../i/b. Other HTML tags are ignored.
